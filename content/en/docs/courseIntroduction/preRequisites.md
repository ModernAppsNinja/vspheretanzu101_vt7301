We recommend taking the [Introduction to VMware Tanzu
Portfolio](https://www.modernapps.ninja/courses/course-v1:modernapps+COU-TP6539+Perpetual/course/) course
prior to taking the vSphere with Tanzu 101 course. 

We also recommend completing the [ModernApps Ninja 101
course](https://www.modernapps.ninja/courses/course-v1:modernapps+COU-MN7417+Perpetual/course/) to
learn about the community resources available to support this course and
maximize your learning experience.

This course assumes familiarity with Kubernetes and Cloud Native
Technologies. If you are not familiar with these technologies, we
recommend checking out [KubeAcademy](https://kube.academy/) by VMware,
which has a terrific set of free, bite-size video resources on the
basics of containers, Kubernetes and cloud native that are great for
beginners.

Before taking this course, you should also have familiarity with vSphere
administration. If you need additional background in vSphere, we
recommend checking out [VMware Hands on Labs](https://hol.vmware.com),
which offers a number of vSphere labs and content.
