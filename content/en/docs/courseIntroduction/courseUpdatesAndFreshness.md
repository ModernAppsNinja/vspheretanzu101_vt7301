We make a strong effort to keep the content in this course as current as
possible, however the Tanzu Portfolio is rapidly growing and there may
be times where this course may not include the newest updates. Always
please refer to the official [VMware Tanzu Portfiolio
Website](https://tanzu.vmware.com/tanzu) and your VMware account team

As part of our effort to keep this course as up-to-date as possible,
this course is on a continuous update lifecycle. This means that the
course can be updated at any time, and new content and requirements may
be added while you are taking your course. We will make effort to notify
students in advance of any significant updates are made to minimize any
changes to course completion requirements.
